Requirements for setting up the web site:

Various perl libraries, as described in the PaperBLAST code base. This
includes CGI and BioPerl.

sqlite3 must be installed

bin/ cgi/ lib/ should match the code repository

The bin directory must include these executables:
mmseqs (for mmseqs2), we use version 7b95387f93e38c3911f9188bc702d63ed3194013
lastal and lastdb (for LAST), we use version 1422
  code at https://gitlab.com/mcfrith/last
muscle3
bl2seq (BLAST align two sequences)

The tmp/cache/ and tmp/hits/ subdirectories
should exist and be writable by the web server.

The PaperBLAST code base must be installed in the parent directory --
i.e., if the cgi scripts are in parent/neighbor/cgi

then the PaperBLAST libraries must be in parent/PaperBLAST/lib

The data/ subdirectory should include neighbor.db, neighbor.sliced,
neighbor.sliced*, and neighbor.faa.gz (created by the bin/build.pl
script).

Important for performance: use
  bin/touchSliced.pl data/neighbor.sliced
to make sure that mmseq's indices are in memory.

The bin directory must include the mmseqs2 executable (named mmseqs)

To fetch identifiers from the fitness browser, neighbor/fbrowse_data
must include the fitness browser database (both sqlite and
blast). This will also require that the bin/blast directory include
the executable fastacmd. We used blast 2.2.18.

Optionally, use the motd file to show a "message of the data" at the
top of the main page and some other pages.
