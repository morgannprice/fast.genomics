Requirements for setting up the web site:

Various perl libraries, as described in the PaperBLAST code base. This
includes CGI and BioPerl.

sqlite3 must be installed

bin/ cgi/ lib/ should match the code repository

The bin/mmseqs (for mmseqs2) and bin/lastal and bin/lastdb executables
must exist. I downloaded the code for LAST from
https://gitlab.com/mcfrith/last

The tmp/cache/ and tmp/hits/ subdirectories
should exist and be writable by the web server.

The PaperBLAST code base must be installed in the parent directory --
i.e., if the cgi scripts are in parent/neighbor/cgi

then the PaperBLAST libraries must be in parent/PaperBLAST/lib

The data/ subdirectory should include neighbor.db and neighbor.mmseqs*
(created by the bin/build.pl script). It should also include a
data/tmp subdirectory that is writable by the web server.

Optional, for performance: use
them into data/, use
  mmseqs touchdb data/neighbor.mmseqs
to make sure that mmseq's index is in memory.

The bin directory must include the mmseqs2 executable (named mmseqs)

To fetch identifiers from the fitness browser, neighbor/fbrowse_data
must include the fitness browser database (both sqlite and
blast). This will also require that the bin/blast directory include
the executable fastacmd. We used blast 2.2.18.

Optionally, use the motd file to show a "message of the data" at the
top of the main page and some other pages.

For querying NCBI, it is recommended to put an NCBI API key in
private/.NCBI.api_key as a single line. For documentation about NCBI's
API keys see
